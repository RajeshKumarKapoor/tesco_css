            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>Used to present large blocks of content or on the mobile view where content works better condensed.</p>
            <h4>Interactions</h4>
            <p>The accordions allow content to be collapsed inside a nested structure.</p>
            <h4>Layout modes</h4>
            <p>There is only a single layout mode for the standard content accordion.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>Only common styles are loaded for this component.</p>
            <h4>SASS Partials</h4>
            <p>You can find the CSS for this component in the following SASS Partials:</p>
            <p>/common-components/accordions.scss</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Use of Javascript</h3>
            <p>The accordion functionality is provided by the Twitter Bootstrap framework. We have abstracted this implementation by creating a jquery plugin that only applies the accordion classnames when requested rather than placing classes straight into the HTML. This is to allow areas of the page to become accordions depending on layout mode: desktop, tablet and mobile. The standard content accordions are applied for all three layout modes. They require a unique ID to applied to function correctly.</p>
            <h4>Non-JS behaviour</h4>
            <p>Text items and headings will be displayed as fully expanded content areas within the page. </p>
            <p><em>see figure 1 below</em></p>
            <p class="styleguide-img">
              <img src="../img/styleguide/accordion.png" alt="non-javascript view of accordion layout">
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Component variants</h3>
            <p>The accordions have two distinct styles: top level and nested items. </p>
